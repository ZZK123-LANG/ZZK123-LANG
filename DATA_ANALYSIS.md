# Hour 2: Data Analysis with AI - The Right Way

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end, you will be able to:
- Understand the systematic approach to analyzing any dataset
- Use AI to guide you through proper data analysis workflow
- Ask the right questions about data quality and structure
- Develop analytical thinking skills for data exploration
- Create a comprehensive data analysis plan using AI assistance

## üöÄ The Data Analysis Mindset

**Before we start coding, let's understand the right way to approach data analysis:**

Data analysis is like being a detective - you need to:
1. **Survey the crime scene** (understand your data)
2. **Look for clues** (identify patterns and issues)
3. **Follow the evidence** (analyze relationships)
4. **Draw conclusions** (interpret findings)

**The Golden Rule**: Never start analyzing data without first understanding what you're working with!

## üìä Part 1: Data Understanding & Assessment 
### **Step 1: Getting to Know Your Data**

#### **AI Prompt for Data Overview:**
> "I have a new dataset called 'UM_C19_2021.csv'. Before I analyze it, help me understand what I'm working with. What questions should I ask about this data first?"

**What the AI should help you think about:**
- What does this dataset represent?
- How many records and columns do we have?
- What are the column names and what do they mean?
- What time period does this data cover?
- What is the main purpose of this dataset?

**Student Action**: Ask the AI these questions one by one to build your understanding.

#### **AI Prompt for Data Structure:**
> "Now that I know what this dataset is about, help me examine its structure. What should I look for to understand how the data is organized?"

**What the AI should guide you to discover:**
- Data types of each column (numbers, text, dates)
- Whether there are missing values
- If the data looks complete and consistent
- Any obvious patterns or anomalies

### **Step 2: Data Quality Assessment**

#### **AI Prompt for Missing Data:**
> "I want to check if my data has any quality issues. How should I approach looking for missing values, duplicates, or other problems?"

**What the AI should help you investigate:**
- Are there missing values in any columns?
- Do the missing values follow a pattern?
- Are there duplicate records?
- Do the data values make sense (e.g., negative numbers where they shouldn't be)?

#### **AI Prompt for Data Validation:**
> "Help me validate that my data makes sense. What should I check to ensure the data quality is good enough for analysis?"

**What the AI should guide you to verify:**
- Date ranges are logical
- Numbers are within expected ranges
- Categorical variables have reasonable values
- No obvious data entry errors

## üßπ Part 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
### **Step 3: Handling Data Issues**

#### **AI Prompt for Missing Data Strategy:**
> "I found some missing values in my dataset. Help me think through the best approach to handle them. What questions should I consider?"

**What the AI should help you decide:**
- Why are values missing? (random vs. systematic)
- How many values are missing?
- Should I remove, fill, or investigate further?
- What impact will my decision have on the analysis?

#### **AI Prompt for Outlier Detection:**
> "I want to identify any unusual values in my data that might be outliers. How should I approach this systematically?"

**What the AI should guide you to consider:**
- What defines an "outlier" for your specific data?
- Are unusual values errors or legitimate data?
- How should you handle outliers once identified?
- What might outliers tell you about your data?

## üîç Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis 
### **Step 4: Understanding Individual Variables**

#### **AI Prompt for Univariate Analysis:**
> "Now I want to understand each variable in my dataset individually. What should I look for when examining each column?"

**What the AI should help you explore:**
- What are the typical values for each variable?
- How are the values distributed?
- Are there any patterns or trends?
- What insights can you draw from single variables?

### **Step 5: Exploring Relationships**

#### **AI Prompt for Bivariate Analysis:**
> "I want to understand how different variables relate to each other. What relationships should I investigate first?"

**What the AI should guide you to examine:**
- How do positive and negative cases relate to time?
- Are there differences between residence types?
- What patterns emerge when you compare variables?
- Which relationships are most interesting or important?

### **Step 6: Time-Based Analysis**

#### **AI Prompt for Temporal Patterns:**
> "Since this is COVID-19 data over time, what time-based patterns should I look for? How should I approach analyzing trends?"

**What the AI should help you investigate:**
- Daily, weekly, and monthly patterns
- Peak periods and their characteristics
- Seasonal or cyclical trends
- Changes over time in different categories

## üìà Part 4: Statistical Insights 
### **Step 7: Drawing Statistical Conclusions**

#### **AI Prompt for Statistical Summary:**
> "I want to create a comprehensive summary of my findings. What key statistics and insights should I focus on?"

**What the AI should help you identify:**
- Most important patterns in the data
- Key differences between groups
- Significant trends over time
- Surprising or unexpected findings

#### **AI Prompt for Business Insights:**
> "How can I translate my statistical findings into meaningful insights that someone could act on?"

**What the AI should guide you to consider:**
- What do the numbers actually mean?
- What actions could be taken based on these findings?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What additional analysis might be needed?

## üé® Part 5: Visualization Strategy 
### **Step 8: Choosing the Right Charts**

#### **AI Prompt for Visualization Planning:**
> "I want to create visualizations that tell the story of my data. What types of charts would be most effective for showing my key findings?"

**What the AI should help you decide:**
- Which charts best show trends over time?
- How to compare different groups effectively?
- What visualizations highlight your main insights?
- How to create a coherent narrative with multiple charts?

### **Step 9: Creating Impactful Visualizations**

#### **AI Prompt for Chart Design:**
> "Help me think about how to make my visualizations clear and impactful. What design principles should I consider?"

**What the AI should guide you to focus on:**
- Clear titles and labels
- Appropriate color choices
- Chart types that match your data
- How to avoid misleading representations
